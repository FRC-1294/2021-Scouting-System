# 2021-Scouting-System
This is an electronic scouting system for FRC team 1294 during the 2020-2021 season, for the game INFINITE RECHARGE. It is written in C# and edited with visual studio 2019 community.

## Why C#?
I was originally going to write this is JS with electron or in Java, but those were being a pain. It took an hour to figure out IPC and get a prototype going for Electron. I started using C# this year, and was able to re-build that prototye in about 10 minutes. After only 90 minutes or so of work, the GUIs are almost ironed out. C# is wonderful to work with.
TL;DR It's easy
